# About
Dog walking application i made as a final project for my server programming course. Made with Java Spring Boot.
The idea is that the applicattion has 2 types of users. One is the a dog owner and one is a dog walker. The dog owner has sign up their dog for a walk and a dog walker can choose from a list of walks to take.
Deployed on Heroku with an PostgresSQL database.

## Current state
A bug causes the app to crash on start, but here is a [link](https://youtu.be/rhgR0tnEcdQ) video of when it does work.

## Future
There are quite some bug in the program currently and it doesn't look visually stunning. The focus of the Server Programming course was just on the back-end, so the visuals don't really matter.
However, i do feel this could be a good project to display. I intend to continue this project in June 2021.

## To Do / bugs:

- [ ] Authenthication is not always enforced. Walkers/dog owners sometimes have admin rights.
- [ ] Add correct homepage/landing page after logging in. Now it has to be done manually.
- [ ] A bug in the code keeps wanting to intialize a database, meaning it will crash the app. The database is persistant, so it doesn't need to be recreated.
- [ ] Add Visuals to make it look nice.
